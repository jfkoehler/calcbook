I do not expect that you have had much experience with mathematics or computers, but that with a semester worth of hard work you can, and must learn.  \n",

    "\n",
    "This course covers the content of a traditional first semester in Calculus with a focus on modeling. Topics include integration and differentiation, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, partial derivatives, tangent lines, optimization and basic differential equations. Applications of calculus and differential equations will be drawn from the social and natural sciences. Students will learn how to integrate numerical, geometric and analytic methods to solve problems, as well as to incorporate technology and mathematical software to compute, communicate, and visualize mathematics. This course is offered every spring and fulfills the second mathematics requirement for the Interdisciplinary Science major. It is also an option to fulfill the mathematics requirement for the Economics major."

    "Because we are operating in a virtual classroom enviornment, my aim is to automate the content delivery portion of the class from that of the problem solving, individual, and group work.  I will release lecture videos for the week on Monday with the expectation that you watch these and note any questions.  You should have these clearly formulated and posted on Piazza prior to class on Wednesday.  We will address any issues in the lectures and work together on a subset of our weekly problem set, focusing on how to use technology to solve these problems and share your solutions.  Following this meeting, you will be responsible for posting a solution to a specific problem every week for which your small group will also be responsible for checking.  \n",

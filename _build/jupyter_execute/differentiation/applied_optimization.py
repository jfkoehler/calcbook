import sympy as sy


# ## Derivative Review
# 
# 1. In your own words define the following:
# 
#  - **Derivative**
#  - **Critical Value**
#  - **Inflection Point**
#  - **Extreme Value**
# 
# 2. Find all critical values of the following functions.  Use these to determine where the function is increasing decreasing, concave up, and concave down:
#  
#  - $f(x) = 3x^4 - 8x^3 - 18t^2$
# 
# 3. Determine any maximum or minimum values using the second derivative test:
# 
#  - $f(x) = x + \sin^2(x)$
# 
# 4. AP Calculus Free Response Derivatives

# ## Applied Optimization: Problems on Closed Bounded Intervals
# 
# The following examples come from OpenStax section on applied optimiazation [here]().
# 
# 

# ### Maximizing Area of Garden
# 
# A rectangular garden is to be constructed using a rock wall as one side of the garden and wire fencing for the other three sides. Given 100 ft of wire fencing, determine the dimensions that would create a garden of maximum area. What is the maximum area?
# 
# ![](https://openstax.org/resources/b628896cf794d3d6e3f4672e01630e4a67ab2005)

# **QUESTION**: Determine the maximum area if we want to make the same rectangular garden as above, but we have 200 ft of fencing.

# ### Maximize the Volume of a Box
# 
# An open-top box is to be made from a 24 in. by 36 in. piece of cardboard by removing a square from each corner of the box and folding up the flaps on each side. What size square should be cut out of each corner to get a box with the maximum volume?

# **QUESTION**: Suppose the dimensions of the cardboard from above are 20 in. by 30 in. Let $x$ be the side length of each square and write the volume of the open-top box as a function of $x$. Determine the domain of consideration for $x$.

# ### Maximizing Revenue
# 
# Owners of a car rental company have determined that if they charge customers $p$ dollars per day to rent a car, where $50 \leq q \leq 200$, the number of cars $n$ they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function $n(p) = 1000 - 5p$.  If they charge \\$50 per day or less, they will rent all their cars. If they charge \\$200 per day or more, they will not rent any cars. Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between \\$50 per day and \\$200 per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?

# **QUESTION**: A car rental company charges its customers  $p$  dollars per day, where  $60 \leq p \leq 150$.  It has found that the number of cars rented per day can be modeled by the linear function  $n(p) = 750 - 5p$.  How much should the company charge each customer to maximize revenue?

# **PROBLEMS**

# 1. To carry a suitcase on an airplane, the length + width + height of the box must be less than or equal to 62in. Assuming the height is fixed, show that the maximum volume is $V = h(31 - (\frac{1}{2})h)^2$. What height allows you to have the largest volume?
# 2. Find the positive integer that minimizes the sum of the number and its reciprocal.
# 3. Find two positive integers such that their sum is 10, and minimize and maximize the sum of their squares.
# 4. You have 400ft of fencing to construct a rectangular pen for cattle. What are the dimensions of the pen that maximize the area?
# 5. You have 800ft of fencing to make a pen for hogs. If you have a river on one side of your property, what is the dimension of the rectangular pen that maximizes the area?
# 6. You need to construct a fence around an area of 1600ft$^2$. What are the dimensions of the rectangular pen to minimize the amount of material needed?
# 7. You are the manager of an apartment complex with 50 units. When you set rent at \\$800/month, all apartments are rented. As you increase rent by \\$25/month, one fewer apartment is rented. Maintenance costs run \\$50/month for each occupied unit. What is the rent that maximizes the total amount of profit?
